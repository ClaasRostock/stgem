# STGEM: System Testing Using Generative Models

STGEM is a tool for black-box testing of cyber-physical systems. It supports falsification of requirements described in  Signal Temporal Logical (STL) by robustness optimization. This is achieved by training a generative machine learning model online to produce system inputs that yield a low robustness. 

STGEM is under development and we are adding new algorithms and features. So far, the tool implements the algorithms presented in these articles:

Workshop on Testing Extra-Functional Properties and Quality Characteristics of Software Systems, ITEQS 2022. To appear. [Preprint available here](www/articles/oganfalsify-ITEQS2022-preprint.pdf).

    - We participated in the SBST 2022 CPS tool competition. A preprint of the competition note is [available here](www/articles/wogan-sbst2022-competition.pdf).
